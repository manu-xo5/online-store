          Hello there! I'm Mohit "Cherry" Saini, 18yo, India. Started learning
          React.js previous year (2019), couldn't catch the JSX and surrendered.
          Months later, tried Anuglar but the decorator were magical for me and
          hopped onto React.js. This time i understood very well and started
          building e-comm website with my friend he didn't knew React.js so i
          had to start alone and this is the result after 3-4 months (was lazy).
